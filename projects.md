### Research Projects

***

### [IOStack: Software Defined Storage for Big Data](http://iostack.eu/)
Funded by the European Commission-H2020 Research and Innovation. **Contract No. H2020-644182.**

The main objective is to create IOStack: a Software-defined Storage toolkit for Big Data on top
of the OpenStack platform. IOStack will enable efficient execution of virtualized analytics 
applications over virtualized storage resources thanks to flexible, automated, and low cost 
data management models based on software-defined storage (SDS).

### [Cloud4Comm: Servicios cloud y redes comunitarias](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2014/01/01/servicios-cloud-y-redes-comunitarias/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness (MEYC), **Contract No. TIN2013-47245-C2-2-R.**

### [CloudSpaces: Open Service Platform for the Next Generation of Personal Clouds](http://cloudspaces.eu/)
Funded by the European Commission—7th Framework Program. **Contract No. FP7-317555.** 

The CloudSpaces project advocates for a paradigm shift from application-centric to person-centric models 
where users can retake the control of their information. CloudSpaces aims to create the next generation
of open Personal Clouds.

### [RealCloud: Real Data Center Cloud Services and Environment](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2011/01/01/real-data-center-cloud-services-enviroment/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCIN), **Contract No. IPT-2011-1232-430000.**

### [DELFIN:Selfadapting Decentralized Systems for the Future Internet](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2011/01/01/delfin-self-adapting-decentralized-systems-future-internet/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Innovation (MCIN), **Contract No. TIN2010-20140-C03-03.** 

The DELFIN project is focused on the design of self-adapting decentralized systems for the Future Internet. 
The network of the future is facing serious challenges due to an enormous increase in traffic, computing 
power and a miriad of novel devices connected to the network. For this reason, a new generation of distributed
systems must provide extreme scalability and adaptivity to variable node and network conditions. We aim to
cover the whole feedback loop of adaptive systems including: sensing and analysis, control and self-regulation,
and finally system adaptation and reaction.

### [NEUROLEARNING: Sistema telemedico de Intervencion Neuropsicologica Basado en Entornos Virtuales Interactivos](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2008/12/23/neurolearning-sistema-telemedico-de-intervencion-neuropsicologica-basado-en-entornos-virtuales/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Industry, Turism and Commerce (MITC), **Contract No. TSI-020501-2008-154.**

### [P2PGRID: Self-adjusting peer-to-peer and Grid Systems](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2007/10/01/p2pgrid-self-adjusting-peer-peer-gird-systems/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (MCYT), **Contract No. TIN2007-68050-C03.** 

P2PGRID project is focused on the design of innovative large scale distributed systems, decentralized, able to adapt to complex environments 
in terms of infrastructure or use and heterogeneous in the access to communication and computation resources.

A key goal is the use of economic algorithms in order to create a Grid infrastructure with efficient resource allocation mechanisms. 
It is thus necessary the study, design, and evaluation of resource allocation algorithms in distributed computation systems. 
Such systems must take into account several variables like client demand, resource state and availability, and the competition 
among services—to provide decentralized and autonomous system adaptivity.

### [POPEYE: Professional Peer Environment Beyond Edge Computing](http://srvweb01.softeco.it/IST-Popeye/)
Specific Targeted Research Project (STREP) funded by the EU—6th Framework Program, IST priority. **Contract No. IST-2006-034241.** 

Next generation collaborative systems will offer the mobile users seamless and natural collaboration amongst a diversity of 
agents within distributed, knowledge-rich and virtualised working environment. However this ambitious goal needs to face
numerous challenges from the underlying communication infrastructure through to the high level application services which, 
depending on the operational need to address, can receive different answers both technological and scientific.

### [PLANET: Plataforma de colaboracion aumentada para el acceso y distribucionde contenidos educativos](http://ast-deim.urv.cat/wppedro/2003/12/01/planet-plataforma-de-colaboracion-aumentada-para-el-acceso-y-distribucion-de-contenidos-educativos/)
Funded by the Spanish Ministry of Science and Technology (MCYT), **Contract No. TIC2003-09288-C02-00.**

The main goal of this project is to develop a low-cost multiuser collaborative platform for advanced training in settings 
like Architecture, Medicine or scientific simulation. The platform will extend an existing Collaborative Virtual Environment
(MOVE) in order to provide advanced interaction and visualization with immersive virtual reality 3D devices like Head Mounted
Displays, gloves and stereoscopic projection systems. We will also experiment with augmented reality systems in mobile scenarios
in order to generate improved training contents for the selected disciplines.
