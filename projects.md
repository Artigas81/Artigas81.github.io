### [Moodly](https://github.com/AkshayAgarwal007/Moodly)
Moodly is a student intimation system for Moodle (NIIT University). It is a desktop app which keeps you updated with notifications of files uploaded or any forum updates (of the courses you are registered in) on NU-Moodle. In addition to that it also helps you download and manage your Moodle course files.

It is is written in Python, uses PyQt5, a set of Python bindings for the Qt5 Application framework for its GUI, Requests for sending HTTP requests and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing and does not make use of any Moodle API because it was intended to be a Web Scrapping Project.

### [ OPEC (One Pi Every Community) ]("") 
Inspired by the Negroponte's One Laptop Per Child and the ongoing coding revolution led by organisations like Raspberry Pi Foundation, Code.org, Coderdojo, etc and after seeing the plight of the underprivileged kids and lack of CS Education in Indian Educational System started project OPEC, where I designed a customised Raspberry Pi computer and a small curriculum for teaching coding consisting of Basics of Computer, LOGO, Blockly, Python, for 4-11 yrs kids. Donated the RPi Computer to an orphpanage and conducted workshops every weekend and taught basics of computer and coding to a group of 60 underprivileged kids over a span of two months in the summer of 2015 alongwith [Abhishek Kumar]() and [Sumit Mukherjee](). 

We also donated notebooks and had to resort to the traditional BlackBoard teaching method as a single device was not enough but the kids practiced it in turns over the week. [Sumit]("") carried on with the workshops after summer vacations and an Hour of Code was also conducted during the Computer Science Week. (Team, Project Lead)

## Research Projects

### A Survey of Wireless Sensor Networks

   A complete literature review of Wireless Sensor Networks including the study of networks from where the field started (SOSUS, DSN) , study of all the literature works concerning various layers of the WSN protocol stack, study of all the developments that took place because of the need of integrating WSN with the Internet (making IEEE 802.15.4 TCP/IP compatible/6LoWPAN,  ZigBee IP etc.) , use of WSNs in Home Automation Systems (Thread, Z-Wave, EnOcean) and new communication technologies like LoRaWAN, Sigfox etx for Low Power Wide Area Network.
   
### Integrating Wireless Sensor Network with the Internet of Things, Approaches, Challenges and Applications

   A study and analysis of the various integration approaches (Gateway, Overlay, Hybrid) and technologies like 6LoWPAN, challenges facing the integration and which approach is suitable depending upon the application.

### Effects of Extrinsic Motivation on Intrinsic Motivation to learn (Educational Psychology)

A study on how extrinsic motivation affects intrinsic motivation(overjustification effect) to learn among students and how it is wrongly put to use in Indian Educational System.


### A Study of the Various Learning Paradigms (Educational Technology)
